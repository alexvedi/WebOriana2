          <h1>TERMINAL 1</h1>
          <h3>2024</h3>
          <p>
            The Glastonbury festival has a proud history of finding space for
            the travelling community. After new age travellers were persecuted
            and attacked in the 1990's it became a place for a marginalised
            people to meet, trade and forge new alliances. Terminal 1 aims to
            honour this spirit and create space for a modern day travelling
            community - migrants.
          </p>
          <p>
            In a time where the lines drawn on a map by our ancestors have come
            to define and divide our world, this is a place without borders that
            celebrates our shared humanity. Hosted by artists, performers and
            crew from all over the world it is unified by the simple message -
            no human is illegal.
